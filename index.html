                    <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
                    <p>Pop punk done right! The first half of this album is very repetitive, but Haley Williams makes up for it with her phenomenal voice and range. The second half is infinitely better. All of the emotions in this is what makes this album so good. </p>

                    <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
                    <p>I know that BTS was so tired after recording this album. It's the same sound over and over- it's not bad just extremely repetitive. Listening to 1 or 2 songs from the album tells you all you need to know. </p>
                    <p>Best Song: What Am I To You</p>

                    <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
                    <p> I'm usually a fan of genre experimentation and this album was no exception. Very reminiscent of 808's & Heartbreak. The features are hit or miss: SZA, 21 Savage and James Gunn were great, but rob49 and Playboi Carti missed the mark. I wouldn't recommend the whole album, but some songs are def worth a listen.  </p>

                    <p>Lady Gaga, I'm so sorry for judging you too hard when I was 10 years old and you wore a meat dress. Oh my God, she can make music. I understand why she's a queen of pop now. </p>

                    <p>After listening to this, never again will I say I listen to everything but country. It's nearly a perfect, skipless album. Orville Peck has done the impossible. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but everyone should give it a try nonetheless. </p>

                    <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
                    <p>A summery album with generic lyrics about love and a department-store-esque sound. Nick and Joe's voices gave this album a few points, but the autotune gives it an ill-fitting electronic sound that's painful to hear. Catchy but painfully average. </p>
